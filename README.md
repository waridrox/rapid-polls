## Description

Rapid Polls makes it easy for you to create polls in an instant and visualize their results in real-time.

## Features

- Create polls in an instant. No payment or signup required
- Real time visualization of results as the votes keep coming in
- QR code for participating in a poll without copying pasting links
- Beautiful, smooth transitions and animations
- Minimal

## Useful Information

- A poll once ended, cannot be started again
- Users cannot vote on a poll before it's started or after it's ended
- Polls and their results are saved indefinitely for now (might change later)
- Thus to manage a poll later, please keep it's url saved in order to revisit it later
- Since the site is hosted on a free tier of [render](https://render.com), you might experience a long initial startup time if the server has been inactive for a while. Please bear with me since this is just a hobby project for now. Thank you.
